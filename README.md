# Innoplex_disease_extraction
## Innoplexus Hackathon

In this project I am dealing with the medical dataset. I have given a challenge to recognize medical entities in the dataset and here been coded with BIO encoding.

### Libraries used

* Numpy: Numpy is free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.

* pandas: Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

* sklearn: Machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features for classification and regression.

* tensorflow: A library mostly used for training deep learning models.
* Keras

### Motivation

Entity recognition helps in automating by recognising custom entities without any manual intervention. It can improve the efficiency of throughput time.

### Datasets

Train and test data where each record comprise the label in BIO encoding. Columns Sent id and Doc Id correspond to which sentence or document this word belong to.


### Approach

In this competition I used simple **Bi Directional LSTM** as base line model got F1 score around ~67 percent

-private leaderboard with score ~67


### Results

I acheived a F1 score ~67 and secured 59th rank in final private leaderboard.
